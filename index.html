                        <p>Due to the remarkable weight, size and cost of examples of 
							mecha within fiction, near-impervious amounts of armour are 
							necessary. However, due to the inefficiencies which come 
							from working with such a scale, the metals used are 
							themselves fictional. </p>
                        <p>Some properties of these sorts of armour include high strength, 
							low weight, invisibility to radar, electrical non-conductivity, 
							and unique electromagnetic properties in response to weaponry 
							of the setting. This defensive capacity generally means that 
							the only way to damage or destroy a mecha is with weapons so 
							large that only another mecha can carry and use them in combat.</p>
						<p>If a modern-day material is used, it will typically be some 
							sort of titanium alloy, but with better properties than what 
							are currently possible today.</p>

                        <p>The cockpit is the most important location as it's where the 
							pilot controls the suit. In most franchises the cockpit 
							will take the fewest liberties technology-wise and rely 
							mostly on elements which exist today. A typical depiction 
							would simply have a chair surrounded with buttons, switches, 
							throttles and a handful of displays. Sometimes large screen 
							or projection-based displays are used, in less-common examples 
							the display is within the equivalent of a current-day virtual 
							reality headset. </p>
                        <p>While the interface the pilot uses is a very straight-forward 
							and simple implementation, sci-fi and creative liberties come 
							in with how the machine responds to the pilot’s input, as it
							mostly manages its own balance and coordination through complex 
							movements initiated through minimal effort on the pilot’s part.</p>

                        <p>Weaponry used falls largely into two categories: weapons 
							which are much larger versions of what we currently have today, 
							and weapons which rely on some form of sci-fi technology</p>
                        <p>Large conventional weapons include things such as machine 
							guns, missiles, artillery and other ballistic weaponry. 
							Sci-Fi weaponry includes laser, beam and plasma guns, 
							high frequency or high heat melee weapons and giant 
							laser swords. In rare occurrences, a melee weapon will 
							be something completely normal with no real technology 
							behind it, such as just a giant sword or a giant club.</p>
						<p>Usually a setting has an over-abundance of jamming and 
							continuous electromagnetic pulse technologies which 
							eliminate the use of any guided weapons and any electronics 
							not within a heavily shielded housing. Because of this, 
							heavily armoured machines which can travel to a very 
							close range where weapons with no targeting or guidance 
							systems can be used effectively are a necessity.</p>

                        <p>The power source typically used when described will be some 
							sort of miniaturized nuclear reactor. Some franchises such as 
							Gundam cite the fusion reaction between helium-3 and heavy 
							hydrogen, as it’s a high-energy reaction which produces no 
							neutron radiation. Due to the scarcity of helium-3 on earth, 
							at least within the massive industrial scale used in these 
							settings, space-based production from gas giants such as Jupiter 
							becomes a necessary form of trade and infrastructure.</p>
                        <p>Thrusters will either be powered directly by the reactor or 
							will use some sort of conventional rocket fuel. Sometimes 
							massive sets are used with space-combat models for 
							increased mobility and power output. </p>
						<p>It isn’t uncommon for underlying technologies and engineering 
							to be glossed over at first and then described at a later time 
							for how they actually work.</p>
